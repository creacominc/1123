[DepthRange]

The "DepthRange" macro  is used to remap the "Far Depth" and "Near Depth" ranges of the depth data in a multi-channel RGB + Z image.

This is done using the custom tool node with the formula of "(log(1 + z1 -  (n1)) / log(1 + (n2) -  (n1)) )". The Number in 1 (n1) control is the Far Depth, and the Number in 2 (n2) is Near Depth.

Note: Page 460 of the Fusion 8 Tool Manual describes the custom tool functions.
