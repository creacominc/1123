[ImageGridExtractor]

This node extracts an image sequence from a single image of an "atlas" tiled image grid layout. This is handy if you are working with photogrammetry or lightfield workflows.

The Fusion "ImageGridCustomTool" node has two user controls called "Horizontal Tiles" and "Vertical Tiles" that let you specify the image grid layout.

This Fusion approach is based upon research by Theodor Groeneboom (theotheo) that uses a TimeStretcher > Custom Tool > Crop node workflow.
