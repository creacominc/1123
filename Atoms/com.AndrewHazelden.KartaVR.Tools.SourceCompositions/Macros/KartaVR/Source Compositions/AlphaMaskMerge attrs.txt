[AlphaMaskMerge]

The AlphaMaskMerge node allows you to merge an external alpha mask image / B-Spline mask with the current image data. Then an Alpha Multiply operation will clean up transparent areas in the image and fill them with black in the RGB channels by pre-multiplying the alpha channel data.
