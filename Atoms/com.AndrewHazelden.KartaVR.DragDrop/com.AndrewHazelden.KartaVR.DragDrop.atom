<h2>KartaVR DragDrop Usage</h2>

<p>1. After you install the "KartaVR DragDrop" package in Reactor, you will need to restart the Fusion/Resolve program once so the new .fu file is loaded during Fusion's startup phase.</p>

<p>2. Select a PTGui Pro v10 .pts file from an Explorer/Finder/Nautilus desktop folder browsing window.</p>

<p>3. Drag the .pts file to the Nodes view. The document will be opened up automatically in the KartaVR "PTGui Project Importer" script dialog.</p>


<h2>Where do I find the "KartaVR DragDrop" file in on disk?</h2>
<p>The "KartaVR DragDrop.fu" file is installed by Reactor to the local folder of:<br>
<a href="file://Reactor:/Deploy/Config/DragDrop/">Reactor:/Deploy/Config/DragDrop/</a></p>
