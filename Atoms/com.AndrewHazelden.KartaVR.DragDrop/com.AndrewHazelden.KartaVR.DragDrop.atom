<p>The "KartaVR PTGui DragDrop.fu" file allows the KartaVR "PTGui Project Importer" script to easily import PTGui Pro v10 .pts documents that are dragged into the Nodes view from a desktop Explorer/Finder/Nautilus folder browsing window.</p>

<p>The "KartaVR PointCloud DragDrop.fu" file allows .xyz point cloud documents to be imported as PointCloud3D nodes when the .xyz files are dragged into the Nodes view from a desktop Explorer/Finder/Nautilus folder browsing window.</p>

<p>Note: After you install the "KartaVR DragDrop" package in Reactor, you will need to restart the Fusion/Resolve program once so the new .fu fils are loaded during Fusion's startup phase.</p>

<h2>Where do I find the "KartaVR DragDrop" file in on disk?</h2>
