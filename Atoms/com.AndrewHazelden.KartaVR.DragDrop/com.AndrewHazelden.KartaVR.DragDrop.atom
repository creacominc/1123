	Description = [[<p>The &quot;KartaVR DragDrop&quot; atom package adds support for new "Drag and Drop" file type handlers to Fusion/Resolve v16+.</p>

<p>The &quot;KartaVR Comp DragDrop.fu&quot; file allows you to import a Fusion .comp file by dragging it into the Nodes view from a desktop Explorer/Finder/Nautilus folder browsing window. This is a quick way to merge in external Fusion .comp documents into an existing open foreground composite and is very handy for Resolve users who work with Media Pool based Fusion comps, or Timeline based Fusion comps.</p>

<p>The &quot;KartaVR PTGui DragDrop.fu&quot; file allows the KartaVR &quot;PTGui Project Importer&quot; script to easily import PTGui Pro v10 .pts documents that are dragged into the Nodes view from a desktop Explorer/Finder/Nautilus folder browsing window.</p>

<p>The &quot;KartaVR PointCloud DragDrop.fu&quot; file allows .xyz point cloud documents to be imported as PointCloud3D nodes when the .xyz files are dragged into the Nodes view from a desktop Explorer/Finder/Nautilus folder browsing window.</p>

<p>Note: After you install the &quot;KartaVR DragDrop&quot; package in Reactor, you will need to restart the Fusion/Resolve program once so the new .fu files are loaded during Fusion's startup phase.</p>
