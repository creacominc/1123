<h2>KartaVR DragDrop Usage</h2>

<p>1. Since .fu files are loaded during Fusion's startup phase, you will need to restart the Fusion program once after you install the "KartaVR DragDrop" package in Reactor.</p>

<p>2. Select a PTGui Pro v10 .pts file from a desktop Explorer/Finder/Nautilus folder browsing window.</p>

<p>3. Drag the .pts file to the Nodes view. The document will be opened up automatically in the KartaVR "PTGui Project Importer" script dialog.</p>
