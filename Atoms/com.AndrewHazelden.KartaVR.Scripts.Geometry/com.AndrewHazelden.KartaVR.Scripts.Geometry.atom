	Description = [[<p>The KartaVR Geometry scripts allow you to send your Fusion Nodes view based "FBXMesh3D" and "AlembicMesh3D" loaded 3D assets, like Wavefront format .obj polygon models, to 3rd party 3D editing tools.</p>

<p>The "KartaVR Geometry" scripts can be found in Fusion under the "Script &lgt; KartaVR > Geometry >" menu. The same scripts can be found in Resolve under the "Workspace > Scripts > KartaVR > Geometry > " menu</p>

</p>This atom package provides Lua scripts that add pipeline interconnectivity support to Fusion/Resolve for <a href="http://www.andrewhazelden.com/projects/kartavr/docs/scripts.html#send-geometry-to-meshlab">MeshLab</a>,
<a href="http://www.cloudcompare.org">CloudCompare</a>, <a href="http://www.cloudcompare.org">CloudCompare Viewer</a>, and <a href="http://www.andrewhazelden.com/projects/kartavr/docs/scripts.html#send-geometry-to-ac3d">AC3D</a>. These pipeline scripts are the perfect helper tool to have if you are starting to explore photogrammetry created models inside of Fusion's 3D system, and need to rework a model to fix geometry issues.</p>

<h2>Where are these scripts saved?</h2>

<p>These Lua scripts are installed by Reactor to the local folder of:<br>
<a href="file://Reactor:/Deploy/Scripts/Comp/KartaVR/Geometry/">Reactor:/Deploy/Scripts/Comp/KartaVR/Geometry/</a></p>


<h2>MacOS GUI Automation Macros</h2>

<p>MacOS users also get access to a "Keyboard Maestro" based set of Fusion v9 (compatible and tested) Alembic Scene, FBX Scene, and PSD Layers re-importing GUI scripting macros.</p>

<p>At first look, these macros might appear to be a of an bit-edge case need if you aren't into 3D Animation/Mograph/VR content creation workflows. But in time you might find out they are pretty handy if you need to do a "Scene" re-import task frequently in fusion, as that can become a pain to constantly go up to the "File > Import > ..." menu every time you need to refresh and of your loaded model's camera paths, texture node connections, or object hiearchy in a comp.</p>

<p>You can find the Keyboard Maestro compatible "KartaVR Macros.kmmacros" file on disk at:<br>
