	Description = [[<p>The KartaVR Geometry scripts allow you to pass your media to 3rd party 3D tools like <a href="http://www.cloudcompare.org">CloudCompare</a>, <a href="https://github.com/wjakob/instant-meshes">Instant Meshes</a>, and <a href="http://www.meshlab.net/">MeshLab</a>. These scripts are accesed using the "Script > KartaVR > Geometry > " menu in Fusion.</p>
	
<p>The "Send Geometry to usdview" script takes AlembicMesh3D nodes that are selected in the Nodes view and sends the .abc models to usdview. The usdview program needs to be installed on the system and listed in the $PATH environment variable. usdview is primarily used to examine PIXAR OpenUSD (USDC/USDA) format scene graphs but it can also work with Alembic models too.</p>

<p>The "Reload Alembic Scene", "Reload FBX Scene", and "Reload PSD Layers" scripts work on macOS systems and allows you to use <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a> and the "KartaVR Macros.kmmacros" file to instantly re-import scenes into Fusion v9.</p>

<p>The "Export Point Cloud" script allows you to export PointCloud3D node based points or FBXMesh3D node OBJ mesh vertices to .xyz and .ply formatted point clouds. Note: <i>There is a "KartaVR DragDrop" atom package in Reactor that provides a matching .xyz point cloud importer functionality via dragging the .xyz file from your desktop folder into the Fusion/Resolve v16+ nodes views.</i></p>
