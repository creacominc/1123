<h2 class="header"><a name="FileSequences">File Sequences</a></h2>
<div class="block">
<p>A file sequence is a group of files that represent individual frames of
a film or animation sequence. DJV will recognize these groups of files and
display them as a sequence in the user interface:</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Individual Files</th><th>File Sequence</th></tr>
    <tr>
    <td>
    render.1.exr<br>
    render.2.exr<br>
    render.3.exr
    </td>
    <td>
    render.1-3.exr
    </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>For a file to be recognized as part of a sequence it must have a frame
number at the end of it's name and the same file extension. Here are some
examples of different naming conventions for file sequences:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>File Name</th><th>Base Name</th><th>Frame Number</th><th>Extension</th></tr>
    <tr><td>render.1.exr</td><td>render.</td><td>1</td><td>.exr</td></tr>
    <tr><td>render.0001.exr</td><td>render.</td><td>0001</td><td>.exr</td></tr>
    <tr><td>render1.exr</td><td>render</td><td>1</td><td>.exr</td></tr>
    <tr><td>render0001.exr</td><td>render</td><td>0001</td><td>.exr</td></tr>
    <tr><td>0001.exr</td><td></td><td>0001</td><td>.exr</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<h2 class="header"><a name="#Formatting">Formatting</a></h2>
<div class="block">
<p>Formatting changes how the file sequences are displayed:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Off</th><th>Sparse</th><th>Range</th></tr>
    <tr>
    <td>
    render.1.exr<br>
    render.2.exr<br>
    render.3.exr<br>
    render.5.exr
    </td>
    <td>
    render.1-3,5.exr
    </td>
    <td>
    render.1-5.exr
    </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>The "sparse" setting will show the exact frames in the sequence including any
gaps where there may be missing frames. The "range" setting will show a continous
sequence even if there are missing frames. The formatting can be set either in
the <a href="FileBrowser.html">file browser</a>, the preferences,
or the <a href="CommandLine.html">command-line</a>.
</p>
</div>

<h2 class="header"><a name="#AutoSequencing">Auto Sequencing</a></h2>
<div class="block">
<p>Auto sequencing will try and automatically determine the file sequence from a
single file. This allows you to drag and drop a file onto DJV and have the
associated file sequence opened automatically. This option may be turned on or off
in the preferences or the <a href="CommandLine.html">command-line</a>.
</div>

<h2 class="header"><a name="#MaximumSize">Maximum Size</a></h2>
<div class="block">
<p>The maximum size limits how many frames are in a file sequence. This value may
be set in the preferences or the <a href="CommandLine.html">command-line</a>.
</div>

<h2 class="header"><a name="#NegativeNumbers">Negative Numbers</a></h2>
<div class="block">
<p>By default negative numbers are not enabled for file sequences since they can
cause issues with some naming conventions. This option may be enabled in the
preferences or the <a href="CommandLine.html">command-line</a>.
