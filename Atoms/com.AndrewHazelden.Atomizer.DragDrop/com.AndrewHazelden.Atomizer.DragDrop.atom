	Description = [[<p>"Atomizer DragDrop.fu" allows Fusion v16+ to open up Reactor .atom packages for editing when the documents are dragged into the Nodes view from an Explorer/Finder/Nautilus based desktop folder browsing window. This aproach can help cut down the amount of time you spend navigating inside the Fusion folder picker dialog. It's possible to drag several .atom files at the same time into the Nodes view and they will all be opened into unique "Atomizer Package Editor" windows.</p>

<h2>Atomizer DragDrop Usage</h2>

<p>1. Since .fu files are loaded during Fusion's startup phase, you will need to restart the Fusion program once after you install the "Atomizer DragDrop" package in Reactor.</p>

<p>2. Select an .atom file from an Explorer/Finder/Nautilus desktop folder browsing window.</p>

<p>3. Drag the .atom file to the Fusion Nodes view. The Reactor atom document will be opened up automatically in the "Atom Package Editor" window for editing and review.</p>
