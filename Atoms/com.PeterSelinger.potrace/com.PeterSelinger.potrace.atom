<p>Potrace is a tool for tracing a bitmap, which means, transforming a bitmap into a smooth, scalable image. The input is a bitmap (PBM, PGM, PPM, or BMP), and the output is one of several vector file formats.  A typical use is to create SVG or PDF files from scanned data, such as company or university logos, handwritten notes, etc. The resulting image is not jaggy like a bitmap, but smooth. It can then be rendered at any resolution.</p>
