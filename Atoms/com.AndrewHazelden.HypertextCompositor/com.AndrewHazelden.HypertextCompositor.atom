<p>The Hypertext Compositor script looks for an HTML formatted sidecar .htm webpage file in the same folder as a .comp file. This allows you to pass along an illustrated guide about the composite to other users.</p>

<p>Hypertext Compositor supports the use of custom Fusion comp based HTML "a href" anchor codes to create guided tutorials that can control the Fusion timeline, adjust comp settings, add nodes/macros/media/3D models, run scripts, and display content in the viewer window when you click on the hyperlinks in Fusion 16/Resolve 16. If you Shift+Click on a hyperlink a preview of the URL will be displayed.</p>

<p>In Fusion v16/Resolve v16 you can also drag an .htm file from your desktop and drop it in the Nodes view and the webpage will be displayed in a new window.<p>

<p>If you would like to learn how to use the custom "a href" anchor codes, look in the header of the "Reactor:/Deploy/Config/HypertextCompositor/HypertextCompositor.lua" script for more information.</p>

<p><i>Hypertext Compositor was inpired by an old-school Fusion term called "SBS" or Side-by-Side that was used to represent an approach where a .lua script could be run by Fusion as soon as a .comp file of the same name was opened. The Hypertext Compositor extends this Side-by-Side system to support comp specific documentation.</i></p>

<h2>Hypertext Compositor Usage</h2>

<p>If you had a composite called "wesuckless.comp", the SBS html sidecar file would be named "wesuckless.htm". When the composite is opened using the "File &gt; Open..." or "File &gt; Open Recent &gt; " menu items, the matching HTML guide would be displayed automatically.</p>
