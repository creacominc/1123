The RSCameraExtractor Fuse extracts the transformation matrix values from the metadata's comma-separated list, if necessary, applies the transformations using the correct ZXY rotation order, and provides the Rotations and Translations in a more easily-accessed table format.</p>
	
	<p>At some point prior to version 2.6.15, Redshift's metadata format changed. The Fuse has been updated to detect and account for the change.</p>]],
