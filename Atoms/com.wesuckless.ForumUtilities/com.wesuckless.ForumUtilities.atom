<p>Currently this package contains the Copy Nodes To Codebox Snippet script. This script lets you copy a selection of Fusion nodes to your clipboard, formatted as a <b>Codebox</b> tagged snippet for pasting in the We Suck Less post editor, with a dated filename.</p>

<p>It doesn't do much else but it's really handy for quickly sharing something!</p>

<p>The included Config file maps the function to CTRL-SHIFT-C in Fusion, and adds the action to Fusion's Edit menu.</p>
