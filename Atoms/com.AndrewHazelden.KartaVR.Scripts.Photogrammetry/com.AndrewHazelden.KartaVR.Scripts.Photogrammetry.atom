	Description = [[<p>The KartaVR Send Media to Photoscan script allows you to quickly and easily key your greenscreen footage in Fusion, and then reconstruct that footage with alpha channels intact inside of AGI Photoscan.</p>


<h2>How do I run this script?</h2>

<p>The "<a href="http://www.andrewhazelden.com/projects/kartavr/docs/scripts.html#send-media-to-photoscan">Send Media to Photoscan</a>" script is accessible in Fusion Standalone's "Script &gt; KartaVR &gt; Photogrammetry &gt; Send Media to Photoscan" menu. In Resolve the scripts can be accessed inside the Fusion page environment using the "Workspace &gt; Scripts &gt; KartaVR &gt; Photogrammetry &gt; Send Media to Photoscan" menu.</p>

<p>The "Send Media to Photoscan.lua" script is installed by Reactor to the local folder of:<br>
