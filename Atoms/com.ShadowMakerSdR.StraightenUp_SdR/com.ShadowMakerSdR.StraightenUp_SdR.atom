<p></p>Make sure you're viewing the original image, by clicking the <strong>original image</strong>-button
<p></p>then use the <strong>horizon left</strong> and <strong>horizon right point controls</strong> to 'draw' a line that's supposed to be horizontal
<p></p>then position the pivot to determine the position that you want the image to rotate around
<p></p>then press the <strong>Show Result</strong>-button 

<p></p>Now you can adjust the 
<strong>size</strong> and 
<strong>edge handling</strong> of the tool and you're done.]],
