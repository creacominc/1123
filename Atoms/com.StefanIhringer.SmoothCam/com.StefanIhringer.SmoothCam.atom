	Description = [[This Fuse uses Dimension's motion vectors to auto-stabilize an image or smooth the camera motion.<p>You first need to analyze your footage by simply playing it back inside Fusion while looking at it in one of the viewers. Then, switch to stabilization or smoothing mode. It's recommended to use a PerspectivePositioner tool for best results. Its corners need to be connected to the SmoothCam's outputs (right-click -> Connect To -> SmoothCam1 -> Unstable Top Left...).]],
