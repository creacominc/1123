	Description = [[<p>The KartaVR <a href="http://www.andrewhazelden.com/projects/kartavr/docs/scripts.html#edit-send-media-to-preferences">Send Media to</a> scripts allow you to pass media from Fusion to the rest of your production pipeline in only a few clicks. The "Send Media to" tools can super-charge your productivity by allowing you to make Fusion/Resolve Fusion page's "Nodes/Flow" view workarea into a "desktop" like hub for your digital content production workflows.</p>


<p>The "Send Media to" scripts provide instant 1-click interconnectivity from your Node view selected Loader/Saver nodes to <a href="http://www.andrewhazelden.com/projects/kartavr/docs/scripts.html#send-media-to-affinity-designer">Affinity Photo</a>,

<h2>Another Hidden Gem in KartaVR</h2>

</p>A hidden gem that has been in <a href="https://www.andrewhazelden.com/projects/">KartaVR</a> (and the earlier Domemaster Fusion Macros) for years is the ability to use a <a href="http://www.andrewhazelden.com/projects/kartavr/docs/scripts.html#send-media-to-touchdesigner">TouchDesigner</a> 360VR workflow connection path that merges offline 360VR compositing in Fusion/Resolve, with a PTGui Pro v10 created .pts camera calibration file, with TouchDesigner's live 360VR video streaming tech that can push video streams from your Laptop or Desktop system to the cloud, and onto mobile devices or HMDs.</p>

TouchDesigner provides HMD connectivity support, the ability to have multiple live video input devices, support for multiple concurrent fullscreen HDMI/SDI/DisplayPort/Thunderbolt/DVI video outputs from your GPU, and the nodes required to do HLS and RTSP streaming of cleanly stitched LatLong, domemaster, cylindrical, cubemap, and custom UV layout (UV warping map) based image projections. And you can do this streaming approach in 360&deg; 2D monoscopic, or sterescopic 3D stitched formats if you know how to work your copy of PTGui Pro in the advanced mode to create the required .pts camera alignment file, and know how to make the requried node connections in TouchDesigner.</p>

<p>This multi-view UV pass warping, and video stream stitching approach works fast and effectively if you want to do some live video streaming and 360VR multi-camera stitching in TouchDesigner. This is powered using KartaVR + PTGui Pro to quickly generate the essential and highly precise "UV pass" warping maps templates for each of your camera rig's camera views.</p>

<p>These UV pass warping maps are generated by KartaVR directly from a PTGui Pro v10 .pts project file in less then a minute using the handy "<a href="http://www.andrewhazelden.com/projects/kartavr/docs/scripts.html##generate-uv-pass-in-ptgui">Generate UV Pass in PTGui</a> script!</p>

<h2>Where do I find the "Send Media to" scripts in Fusion and Resolve?</h2>

<p>The "<a href="http://www.andrewhazelden.com/projects/kartavr/docs/scripts.html#edit-send-media-to-preferences">Send Media to</a>" scripts are accessible in Fusion Standalone's "Script &gt; KartaVR &gt; Send Media to &gt;" menu. In Resolve the scripts can be accessed inside the Fusion page environment using the "Workspace &gt; Scripts &gt; KartaVR &gt; Send Media to &gt;" menu. Make sure to run the "Edit Send Media to Preferences" script once to select the right executable filepaths for the external applications you plan to use with Fusion.</p>

<p>The "Send Media to" scripts are installed by Reactor to the local folder of:<br>
<a href="file://Reactor:/Deploy/Scripts/Comp/KartaVR/Send Media to/">Reactor:/Deploy/Scripts/Comp/KartaVR/Send Media to/</a></p>
