<h1>KartaVR Local Documentation</h1>

<p>The KartaVR documentation has detailed notes about all of the macros and scripts that are included in the literally massive VR toolset that is KartaVR v4 that has evolved continuously since its intial release in 2014. You can browse the local help documentation in either <a href="file://Reactor:/Deploy/Docs/KartaVR/index.html">HTML</a> or <a href="file://Reactor:/Deploy/Docs/KartaVR/">markdown</a> format. Also, there is an <a href="http://www.andrewhazelden.com/projects/kartavr/docs/">online version</a> of the same help documentation, too.</p>

<p>The local documentation is installed to the "AllData:/Reactor/Docs/KartaVR/" based PathMap folder path of:<br>
<a href="file://Reactor:/Deploy/Docs/KartaVR/index.html">Reactor:/Deploy/Docs/KartaVR/index.html</a></p>
