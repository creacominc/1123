	<p>Script to Import JSON 3D Files of chemical structures as published on <br>
	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pccompound<br>
	A good example is<br>

	Follow the thread on WSL here: https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=1727<br><br>

	<b>For Fusion earlier than 9.0.1 this Script requires the lua JSON library from:</b><br>
	https://gist.github.com/tylerneylon/59f4bcf316be525b30ab<br>
	<b>to be present in (e.g.) %AppData%\Blackmagic Design\Fusion\Modules\Lua</b><br>
	As of Fusion 9.0.1 the dkjson library is already included.<br><br>
	
	Download the desired .json file from the 3D-Section of any compound on that site.<br>
	Run the Script to import that structure into Fusion.<br><br>
		
	Beware! This might create humongous amounts of tools on your flow!
	Especially with interesting looking structures like:<br>
	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/186342#section=2D-Structure<br>
	
	If you want to Render with SuperSampling turned on,<br>
	a LineThickness of 10 and MaterialBoost of at least 2 is recommended.<br><br>
	
	Use the modify script to change the attributes of Atoms and Bonds.<br><br>
	
	Version 1.1 changes:<br>
		- Massive improvements for the materials and modification options.<br>
		- Option to create text-labels on the atoms.
		- General improvements.
