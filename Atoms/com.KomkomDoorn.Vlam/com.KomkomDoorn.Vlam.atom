<h2>Vlam</h2>
<br>
<p>A free and open source plugin for Fusion which creates weird and wonderful (pseudo) three-dimensional fractals.<br>
The plug-in is based on the original source code by Scott Draves (1993) and Andre B. Davidson (1999).<br>
It’s open source, it’s free, … and it can be terribly slow and beautiful. What more do you want?</p>
