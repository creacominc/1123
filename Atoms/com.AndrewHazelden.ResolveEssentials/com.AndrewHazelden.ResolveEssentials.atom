	Description = [[<h2>Scene Import for Resolve</h2>

The "Scene Alembic Import", "Scene FBX Import", "Scene EDL Import", "Scene Shape Import", "Scene SVG Import", and "Scene Track Import" comp scripts make it possible to correctly import 3D scene data into the flow area with cameras, meshes, and texture maps.

<h2>MediaOutUltra for Resolve</h2>

The "MediaOutUltra" macro provides a way to render the Fusion comp to disk directly using the left or right viewer window graphics context. This allows you to bypass Resolve's Delivery module.

<h2>FBXExporterUltra for Resolve</h2>

The "FBXExporterUltra" macro provides a way to render FBX files to disk in the Fusion page.

<h2>New Image View</h2>

The "New Image View" comp script allows you to create a new floating image viewer window that can be used to display your node based ouput.

<h2>Hotkey Manager</h2>

The "Hotkey Manager" comp script opens up a window that allows to you edit the active hotkeys in the Fusion page.

<h2>Fusion Preferences for Resolve</h2>

The "Fusion Preferences" tool script provides access to the legacy Fusion Preferences window

<h2>Fusion About for Resolve</h2>

The "Fusion About" tool script provides access to the legacy Fusion About window

<h2>Composite Import/Export for Resolve</h2>

<p>This atom provides a Resolve config .fu hotkey file that allows you to import and export your current Fusion page composites. You can export the active Flow area composite to disk using the Alt+S (Linux/Windows) or Option+S (macOS) hotkey. You can import a .comp file into the Flow area using the Alt+O (Linux/Windows) or Option+O (macOS) hotkey. Resolve Fusion page Tool scripts called "Composite Export.lua" and "Composite Import.lua" are also included.</p>

<h2>Render Selected</h2>

<p>The Render Selected script will render the active node in Resolve's Fusion page Nodes view. This means you can still output content in Resolve's Fusion Page directly to disk using nodes like the FBXExporter node, or a custom EXRIO based Fuse.</p>

<h2>Open Containing Folder</h2>

<p>The Open Containing Folder script reads the active Nodes view selection and then opens a desktop Explorer/Finder/Nautilus file browser window to show the containing folder that holds the selected media.</p>

<h2>Show Folder Menu</h2>

<p>The Show Folder menu allows you to quickly jump to the supporting folders used to store Fusion PathMap based resources.</p>

<h2>Resources Menu</h2>

<p>The Resources menu allows you to quickly jump to the supporting resources that are needed to maximise your use of the Resolve Fusion page.</p>

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>Reactor's uncanny ability to add power-user features users to Resolve 15 is quite astounding!</p>
