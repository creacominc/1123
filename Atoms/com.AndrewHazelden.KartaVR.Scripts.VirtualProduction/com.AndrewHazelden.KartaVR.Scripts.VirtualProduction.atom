	Description = [[<p>The KartaVR &quot;Virtual Production&quot; atom allow you optimize you on-set VFX workflows and interact with match moving department provided information like camera data, point clouds, and stand-in models. This is essential for effective scene integration and virtual produciton efforts in Fusion. The scripts in this atom package are the rare and exotic &quot;rosetta stone&quot; like tools that will allow your pipeline to interchange Fusion matchmoving data with external DCC apps, and make it a painless process to export PIXAR USD ASCII and Maya ASCII formatted copies of your Fusion 3D scene graph based nodes. This atom package is a beta toolset that will evolve and change in the leadup to KartaVR v5 in 2020.</p>
	
<h2>Export Point Clouds</h2>

<p>The &quot;Export Point Cloud&quot; script allows you to export PointCloud3D node based points or FBXMesh3D node OBJ mesh vertices to XYZ ASCII (.xyz), PLY ASCII (.ply), Maya ASCII 2019 (.ma), and PIXAR USD ASCII (.usda) formats. AlembicMesh3D nodes can be exported to the PIXAR USD ASCII (.usda), and Maya ASCII 2019 (.ma) format. Keyframe animated Camera3D nodes with per-frame XYZ translation/rotation keys can be exported to the PIXAR USD ASCII (.usda) format. Static (non-animated) Camera3D nodes can be exported to the Maya ASCII 2019 (.ma) format.</p>

<p>Note: <i>There is a &quot; KartaVR DragDrop&quot;  atom package in Reactor that provides a matching .xyz point cloud importer functionality via dragging the .xyz file from your desktop folder into the Fusion/Resolve v16+ nodes views.</i></p>

<h2>IMU Tools</h2>

<p>The &quot;IMU Tools&quot; script is a new tool that is still under development. It allows to you browse through keyframed IMU (Internal Measurement Unit) metadata information using a spreadsheet like viewer window. This information comes from modern action cameras like the GoPro Fusion dual lens 360&deg; video camera. These action cameras are interesting in that they automatically store gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer readings in a special data track for every single MP4 video recording. This hidden metadata informaton can allow for advanced image processing workflows to happen such as IMU data driven XYZ rotation based image stabilization, automated 3D camera tracking, AR/XR like post-production effects, and more.</p>

<p>The current alpha version of the IMU Tools script expects the metadata information to be pre-extracted from the MP4 video and stored in a Lua Table structure for faster I/O access inside of Fusion. A sample IMU Tools formatted Lua table file named &quot;gopro_fusion_camera_metadata.table&quot; is provided in the "KartaVR Images" atom package at the following folder location on disk:<br>
<a href="file://Reactor:/Deploy/Macros/KartaVR/Images/">Reactor:/Deploy/Macros/KartaVR/Images/</a></p>

<p>Also included is the &quot;MadgwickAHRS.lua&quot; script which a Lua port of the open-source <a href="http://x-io.co.uk/open-source-imu-and-ahrs-algorithms/">Madgwick&#39;s IMU and AHRS</a> algorithm. This is a proof-of-concept script with Fusion Console based output. It provides the core Lua functions needed for inertial measurement data processing and offers an implementation of an AHRS (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_and_heading_reference_system">Attitude and Heading Reference System</a>) that can be adapted to run inside of Fusion Standalone, Fusion Render Node, or from the terminal with FuScript.</p>
