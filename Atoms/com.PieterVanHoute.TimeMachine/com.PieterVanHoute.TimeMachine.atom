	Description = [[<p>Time Machine Modifier Fuse</p>
	
	<p>A modifier designed to greatly simplify very complex retiming of footage.</p>
	
	<h3>We Suck Less companion topic:</h3>
	<p>https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=74</p>
	
	<p>Typically used in combination with a TimeStretcher node, but can be used to modify any parameter.</p>
	
	<p>For motion graphics, try combining with the Suck Less Audio Modifier.</p>
	
	<p>A quick rundown of the modes:</p>

	<pre>
	Warp: scrubs inside the Source Start to Source End range using the Time Warp slider.
	Remap: maps Source Start-End to Target Start-End
	Delta: steps through a range in user definable steps.
	Lock Start: locks Source Start to Target Start frame, and you can use Speed/Step to go from there.
	Lock End: locks Source End to Target End frame, and you can use Speed/Step to go from there.
	Random: random frames from within the Source range.
	Hold: holds a frame.
	Skip: skips frames, so a setting of 2 starting from 1 does 111444777...
	Offset: offsets your source range forward or backward.
	Trigger: repeatedly runs through your frames, based on thresholds.
	XSheet: retime your source frames using an exposure sheet with a mini scripting engine.
	Switch: easily switch to user definable starting points. (requires Fusion 7.7 or later)
