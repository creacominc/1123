<p>In addition to Redshift's own tone mapping method, the macro also includes John Hable's Filmic Tone Mapping, as used for the video game Uncharted 2, a Highlight Compression mode similar to that performed by the Corona render engine, and an Exponential Luma mode that clamps luminance while preserving hue.</p>

<p>Find it with the Color tools.</p>]],
