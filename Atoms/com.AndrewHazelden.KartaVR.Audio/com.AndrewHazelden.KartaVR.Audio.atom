	Description = [[<p>The KartaVR audio atom package provides the sound effect files used in KartaVR's Lua scripts.</p>

<p>These sound effects can be activated as a status "alert" in many of the KartaVR scripts that batch process folders of 360VR footage. Enabling the sound effects is a simple QOL (Quality of Life) thing that allows you to take a short coffee break to relax, and know the exact instant when a computationally demanding task has finished running.</p>

<h3>Licensing</h3>

<p>These sound files are not public domain audio files, and as such are covered by copyright licensing. Please do not re-distibute the bundled KartaVR sound files outside of the Reactor atom repository as that will violate the license terms under which KartaVR acquired the rights to use the sound files.</p>
